# custom-rwlock
A dashed-out RwLock&lt;T> shared-reader, exclusive-writer data structure implementation

This is me basically just trying to do an exercise from [Rust Atomics and Locks] before reading through the implementation provided there. Odds are it's at least mostly correct (and maybe fully so, because I'll probably go through and fix stuff upon reading the provided implementation). But you would be a fool to rely on this. :-)
